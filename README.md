A Web company's Triangle Challenge you must transverse Triangle to find the sum: 
About dozen lines of Python
This is pre interview Q by a web company that screens the candidates by this puzzle.
I seen a few java and other answers that did THE algorithm, but mine is extremely simple
About Dozen lines in Python.
This may not be the most sophisticated answer but I am pretty sure this is likely the shortest & most understandable
KISS principle at work
Here's the Q
#By starting at the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 27.

        5
      9  6
    4   6  8
  0   7  1   5

#I.e. 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 = 27
One just have to travel down keeping track of indexes & next
Few lines 3~4 for sanity check but not much beyond that
